Q.1 In a town, the percentage of men is 52. The percentage of total literacy is 48.
If total percentage of literate men is 35 of the total population, write a program to
find the total number of illiterate men and women if the population of the town is
80,000.

Q.2 An Insurance company follows t h e following rules to calculate premium.
(1) If a person’s health is excellent and the person is between 25
and 35 years of age and lives in a city and is a male then the
premium is Rs. 4 per thousand and his policy amount cannot
exceed Rs. 2 lakhs.
(2) If a person satisfies all the above conditions except that the
sex is female then the premium is Rs. 3 per thousand and her
policy amount cannot exceed Rs. 1 lakh.
(3) If a person’s health is poor and the person is between 25 and
35 years of age and lives in a village and is a male
then the premium is Rs. 6 per thousand and his policy
cannot exceed Rs. 10,000.
(4) In all other cases the person is not insured.
Write a program to output whether the person should be insured or not, his/her
premium rate and maximum amount for which he/she can be insured.

Q.5 Write a program in C to count the total number of duplicate elements in an array.
Test Data :
Input the number of elements to be stored in the array :3
Input 3 elements in the array :
element - 0 : 5
element - 1 : 1
element - 2 : 1
Expected Output :
Total number of duplicate elements found in the array is : 1
